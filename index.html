      <p>Hi my name is Vageli Stathatos! I was born and raised in Houston, Texas and have always loved problem solving. I am a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of Houston. I completed my bachelors in electrical engineering and minor in mathematics and business administration. I currently am a program lead engineer at Caterpillar and have been with them since 2020 when I was an intern. I am taking the coding bootcamp to advance my knowedge in coding and have a great foundation to add to in order to progress my career to transition into a Technical Product Manager. After the bootcamp I plan to complete my Masters in Science in COmputer science from UT as well. I am excited to start the bootcamp and learn the ins and outs of coding and what it has to offer.</p>
